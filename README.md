This is a react app admin panel with different charts to keep track of your business. You can also navigate to see the details of each product or user.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React, SCSS, TypeScript, HTML

## Optimizations
The UI is perfect on tablets and desktops. Would want to optimize a breakpoint for the mobile screens.

## Lessons Learned:
Presenting data on graphs and separating UI into smaller pieces. Passing props between components and parents.
